### Project: **Image Storage and Metadata Management with AWS S3 and MongoDB**

This project demonstrates how to build a Node.js server that integrates with Amazon S3 for image storage and MongoDB for metadata management. The primary objective is to create a system where users can upload images via a web interface (built with HTML or React), store these images directly in AWS S3, and save the image URLs along with relevant metadata in a MongoDB database.

#### Objectives:
- **Image Upload and Storage**: Allow users to upload images through a web interface and store them securely in an Amazon S3 bucket.
- **Metadata Management**: Store the image URLs and any associated metadata in MongoDB for easy retrieval and management.
- **Scalability and Flexibility**: Leverage AWS's scalable infrastructure and MongoDB's flexible schema to handle various image types and metadata requirements.

#### AWS Services Used:
- **Amazon S3**: For secure, scalable storage of images.
- **Amazon IAM**: To manage access to the S3 bucket.
- **AWS SDK**: To interact with S3 and perform operations such as uploading files.

#### Technologies Used:
- **Node.js**: Backend server for handling image uploads and managing API requests.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building the server-side logic.
- **MongoDB**: Database to store image URLs and metadata.
- **Mongoose**: ORM for MongoDB, simplifying database interactions.
- **HTML/React**: Frontend interface for user interactions (uploading images, viewing uploads).
